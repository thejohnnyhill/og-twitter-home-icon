# OG Twitter Home Icon
This is a Boost for the Arc browser that will bring back the proper Twitter Home icon, and do away with that [monstrosity](https://twitter.com/bonniekatewolf/status/1711822926025294165) that Elon and team have unveiled:

This script is written in vanilla JavaScript, so it's light, compatible with other custom styling/theming, and can also be used as a standalone userscript in plugins like Tampermonkey.


## Installation Instructions

- In Arc, with Twitter open, click the plus (+) button at the bottom of the sidebar, and click "New Boost"
- Click the "Code {}" button
- Copy and paste the contents of the script.js file in this repository into the JS tab of the code editor
- Rename the boost "OG Twitter Home Icon" (or whatever you want, really, it's your browser)
- Done!
